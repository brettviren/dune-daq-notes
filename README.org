Some DUNE Far Detector DAQ Notes

* Caveat

These are all conceptual works in progress and not necessarily correct, precise or "official" in any way.

* Mechanics

** Documents

The notes are largely written in Emacs org-mode.  

It may be convenient to export them to PDF.  To do so, visit the =.org= file in any recent Emacs and hit =C-c C-e l p=.

** Figures

The graph figures make use of GraphViz.  They can be generated with

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
dot -Tpdf -o <filename>.pdf <filename>.dot
#+END_EXAMPLE

While editing them them it may be convenient to use

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
./watchdot <filename>.dot
#+END_EXAMPLE

This script may need local adjustment to your environment.
